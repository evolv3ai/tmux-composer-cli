 Tips for getting started:

 1. Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude
 2. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 3. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results

 ※ Tip: Hit shift+tab to cycle between default mode, auto-accept edit mode, and
 plan mode

● I'm ready to help you plan your feature. Please describe what you'd like
  to build, and I'll create a detailed plan for implementation.
