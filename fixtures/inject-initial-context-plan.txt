● Based on my analysis, this appears to be a minimal test project with:
  - An empty readme.md file
  - A basic package.json defining a simple Node.js project
  - A control.yaml file that seems to define some agent configurations

  What would you like to plan for this project? Some possibilities include:
  - Setting up a proper development environment
  - Adding functionality to the project
  - Creating documentation
  - Setting up testing infrastructure
  - Adding build/deployment configurations

  Please let me know what specific goals you have in mind, and I'll create
  a detailed plan for you.
