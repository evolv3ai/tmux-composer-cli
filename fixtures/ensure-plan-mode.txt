  ready to help. I should keep this response very brief and direct,
  following the guidelines to be concise.

  Looking at the context:
  - This is a Next.js/React project with Shadcn/UI and TailwindCSS
  - It appears to be some kind of icon creator UI based on the directory
  name
  - There are tmux panes running with nvim, tests, and build watching
  - The project uses pnpm as package manager
  - Server components and server actions are preferred over API routes

  The user simply wants me to say "I'm ready, let's go!" as they specified.

● I'm ready, let's go!
